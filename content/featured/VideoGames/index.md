Single Page Application (SPA) called "Videogames App" using React for the front end and Redux for state management. This SPA allows users to view different video games along with their information by utilizing the RAWG API. Additionally, I created a back end using Node.js and Express to enhance the functionality of the original [RAWG API.](https://rawg.io/).
